Image outpainting is a~task in the~area of generative artificial intelligence, where the~goal is to expand an~image in a~feasible way. The~goal of this work is to create an~machine learning algorithm capable of sky image outpainting by implementing several recently proposed techniques in the~field. We train three models, a~tokenizer for converting images to tokens and back, a~masked generative transformer for performing outpainting on tokens and a~super sampler for upscaling the~result, all on a~dataset of sky images. Then, we propose a~procedure that combines the~trained models to solve the~outpainting task. We describe the~results of training each model and those of the~final algorithm. Our contribution consists mainly in providing a~working, open-source implementation including the~trained models capable of sky image outpainting.
